# SmartStreetLight
A smart street lighting system that automatically turns ON when the light falls down, and also it is capable of indicating if any one of the street light is not working. The ultimate component I used here is the NPN Transistor and Photoresistor. I uploaded the final working model images and a document of the model :)
